# 1.19.2-v2.0.1
Small bugfix and mod compat update.

## Additions
- Added a bunch of item tags for easy loot injection by other mods.
	- Tags applicable for every dungeon:
		- `dungeons_plus:tags/items/loot/common` Can generate 1-3 of an item
		- `dungeons_plus:tags/items/loot/uncommon` Can generate 1-2 of an item
		- `dungeons_plus:tags/items/loot/rare` Can only generate 1 item
	- Each dungeon with loot chests has tags as well. The format is as follows:
		- `dungeons_plus:tags/items/loot/<structure>/<rarity>`
		- Supported structures:
			- `tower`
			- `reanimated_ruins`
			- `snowy_temple`
			- `leviathan`
			- `warped_garden`
			- `soul_prison`


## Fixes
- Subtitles weren't localized properly
- The Snowy Temple would look weird on cliffs, now it fills blocks below itself.
