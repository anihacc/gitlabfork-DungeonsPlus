Updated to 1.18.2 and revamped all structures.

## Additions


## Changes

### Tower
- Updated visuals to include basalt support beams, blackstone bands, and improved mossy/cracked stone brick distribution.
- Now generates with 5-7 floors.
	- 1 entry room
	- 3-5 spawner room (Zombie, Skeleton, or Spider)
	- 1 Vex room at the top
- Added 2 new spawner rooms for every mob (Zombie, Skeleton, Spider, and Vex) bringing the total rooms for each type up to 3.
	- Each room can only generate once per tower, so there will be no more duplicate rooms.
	- Improves variation.
- Added 2 new entry rooms bringing the total up to 3.
- Towers have a 30% chance to generated as infested.
	- Infested towers replace 5% of their stone bricks with cobwebs.
	- Any block in the tower that can be infested by Silverfish has a 7% chance to be infested.
- Updated the loot in the chests to be more unique to the tower instead of just using the vanilla dungeon chest.
- Mobs that spawn in the tower can spawn in sky light levels between 0 and 14.
	- This makes the tower just as difficult during the day as it would be at night since mobs still spawn.
