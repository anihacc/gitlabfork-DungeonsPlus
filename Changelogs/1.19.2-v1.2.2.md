# 1.19.2-v1.2.2
Small bug fixes and tweaks

## Changes/Additions
- Warped Axe
	- Teleports players to target blocks.
	- Sneaking when you throw the axe disables teleportation, at the cost of reduced damage.
	- Reduced the damage added from enchantments.
	- Now accepts fire aspect.
	- Added a tag for what enchantments can go on this to allow other mods/datapacks to add custom enchantment options: `dungeons_plus:enchantment/warped_axe_applicable`

## Fixes
- Warped Axe
	- No longer goes through portals.
	- Now saves item data properly.
	- Throwing it at an enderman didn't interact the way you'd expect.
